- Fixes for BTD6 v49

### Folder Location Change

To prepare for an upcoming new version of MelonLoader, some directories created by Mod Helper will be moving to a new
location.
This should happen automatically on startup; any issues will display as load warning for Mod Helper in the mods menu
that can be addressed by just moving the folders manually if need be.

- The `BloonsTD6 Mod Helper` folder that previously was within the `Mods` folder is now the `BTD6ModHelper` folder
  within the root `BloonsTD6` directory
- The `Disabled` folder that previously was within the `Mods` folder is now the `Disabled Mods` folder within the root
  `BloonsTD6` directory
