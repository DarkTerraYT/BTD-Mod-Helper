- Added a ModBloonOverlay class for making custom Bloon Overlays
  - NOTE: Due to a MelonLoader bug, these won't properly display unless you're on ML 0.6.6 or higher
- Accounted for a Unity bug that was affecting the internal durations of embedded AudioClips
- Added a Sprite.TrySaveToPNG() extension like the one for Textures except accounting for position and size within a larger texture atlas
