- Pause Screen Mods Button now shows number of active mods
- Updated icon for Pause Screen mods button
- Made it less likely for other mods to have errors if they tried to use file/folder picker popups outside standard mod settings
- Apopalypse Mode is now correctly affected by the Round Set changer
- Made the Round Changer button also show up in the Challenge Editor Play screen
  - Note: The Round Set Changer would always technically apply to challenges, this is just making it clearer and easier
    to change without going back to the normal map play screens
