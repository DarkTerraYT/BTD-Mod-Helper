- Created a new Updater Plugin that keep Mod Helper and other mods automatically up to date when you start the game
  - Enabled by default, use the "Auto Update" setting at the top of Mod Helper Settings to control whether this happens
  - Mod Helper will automatically manage the download and installation of the Updater Plugin as long as the setting is enabled
  - The Updater Plugin has its own settings page to control which mods you want to keep updated, if not all of them
- For `ModRoundSet`, `Rounds1Index` will now finally be true by default
- Added a VanillaAudioClips file listing all the GUIDs for game sounds
- Updated the game data exporter to use a custom serializer implementation that does not fail on any towers (e.g. top path alchemists)
